**1. Project Overview** (~1 paragraph)

Write a short abstract describing your project. Summarize the main objectives, key features, and any extensions or additional functionality implemented beyond the basic requirements.

This project completes a very specific function. It presents a web app to a user and prompts them to input a location. This location is then pushed to the next page of the website using the POST method where it is ran through a python program working in tandem with the MBTA API. This program returns both the nearest MBTA stop (Calculated using longitude and latitude), and whether that stop is handicap acessible. This information is then presented on the web app, and the user is prompted to input another location.

**2. Reflection** (~3 paragraphs + screenshots)

After you finish the project, Please write a short document for reflection.

- Discuss the **development process** point of view, including what went well and what could be improved. Reflect on topics such as project scoping, testing, debugging, and any specific challenges encountered. What strategies helped the team succeed, and what adjustments might have made the project smoother?

The development process of this project was quite smooth. While it initially seemed very challenging, we quickly understood that there were two halves, the python API program, and the flask web app. This made it much less frightening, as there were two clear aspects that needed to be completed and eventually merged into one functional product. We worked on the API and Flask sections simultaniously which actually ended up being very helpful because we could use progress in one part to help test out the functionality of the other. 

- Discuss your **team's work division**, including how the work was planned to be divided and how it actually happened. Address any issues that arose while working together and how they were addressed. Finally, discuss what you would do differently next time.

Our team divided work quite evenly. We did all of the work on this project in person, meaning that each person was able to understand how the code was evolving even if they weren't the one writing it. It also helped because Cole is quite strong with APIs and was able to demonstrate why the errors were occuring and the means to fix them very well. During this, Andrew worked on the flask app and was able to use the collective understanding of the first part to ensure a smooth integration when combined into one program. This was a great process and test run for our final project, as we learned that in person collaboration is valuable for many many reasons when coding and we will continue to pirotitize this going forward. 

- Discuss from a **learning** perspective, what you learned through this project and how you'll use what you learned going forward. Share your experience with AI tools - did they enhance your efficiency or understanding, and if so, how? What do you wish you had known beforehand that would have helped you succeed? Include screenshots showing key stages of development or specific challenges you overcame.

This project was a great exercise in implementing real world functionality from API's and connecting them to the web design techniques we have learned in class. This is incredibly applicable for our term project as we must leverage APIs in order to build out the functionality of our program and apply it in the real world with a web app.
In terms of AI usage it was incredibly helpful with brainstorming some of the potential issues that we ran into when trying to access the API. PUT SCREENSHOT HERE COLE
It also was very helpful with explaining the concept of the template and how it works in tandem with the rest of the program to deliver its value as this was an aspect of the project we had minimal experience working with.(Albiet in a very long winded way)
